# Clustering-algorithm

This clustering algorithm I am proposing is based on the <b>Linde, Buzo, and Gray (LBG)</b> algorithm -- Generalized Llyod algorithm, the original paper can be found in [DOI: 10.1109/TCOM.1980.1094577](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1094577).

I based my work on the book "Fundamentals of Internet of Things" by Sudhir Kumar in [DOI: 10.1201/9781003225584](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003225584/fundamentals-internet-things-sudhir-kumar). In chapter 3 he proposes a clustering technique, I made some modifications and created the Python code for computation and visualization in 2 Dimensions.
